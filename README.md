# Fraud Detection System Using Neural Networks

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive Fraud Detection System that leverages neural networks to identify fraudulent transactions in financial datasets. It is designed with modularity and scalability in mind, adhering to best practices in software engineering and object-oriented programming (OOP). The system utilizes a range of open-source tools for data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Tools and Technologies

### 1. **Python**
   - The primary programming language used for developing the system. Python is known for its simplicity and a rich set of libraries, making it ideal for machine learning and data processing tasks.

### 2. **PyTorch**
   - A powerful deep learning framework used to build and train the neural network models. PyTorch is known for its dynamic computation graph and ease of use in building custom models.

### 3. **Apache Kafka**
   - Kafka is used for real-time data streaming. It allows for the ingestion of transaction data into the system as it occurs, making the fraud detection system responsive to new data in real-time.

### 4. **PostgreSQL**
   - A robust, open-source relational database system used for storing and managing transaction data. PostgreSQL supports advanced data types and performance optimizations, making it suitable for this project.

### 5. **Redash**
   - An open-source tool for querying, visualizing, and sharing data. Redash is integrated into the project for creating visual dashboards that help in analyzing model performance and data insights.

### 6. **Kaggle Datasets**
   - The project utilizes two key datasets:
     - **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset**: A dataset of credit card transactions, labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
     - **IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Dataset**: A complex dataset combining transactional and identity information to detect fraudulent transactions.

## Detailed Module Descriptions

### Data Ingestion (`data/data_ingestion.py`)
- Handles the ingestion of raw transaction data using Apache Kafka. This module reads data from a CSV file and streams it into Kafka topics for real-time processing.

### Data Preprocessing (`data/preprocess.py`)
- This module preprocesses the raw transaction data by cleaning it, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare it for model training.

### Model Definition (`models/model.py`)
- Defines the architecture of the neural network used for fraud detection. The model is built using PyTorch and consists of multiple fully connected layers with ReLU activations and a sigmoid output layer.

### Model Training (`models/train.py`)
- This script handles the training process of the neural network. It reads the preprocessed data, feeds it into the model, and optimizes the model parameters using backpropagation.

### Model Evaluation (`models/evaluate.py`)
- Evaluates the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix. This helps in understanding how well the model is able to detect fraudulent transactions.

### Database Operations (`database/db_operations.py`)
- Contains functions for creating database tables, inserting records, and querying the transaction data stored in PostgreSQL.

### Visualization (`visualization/visualize.py`)
- Uses Redash to create and manage visual dashboards. This module allows users to interact with the data and visualize the results of the fraud detection model.

### Logging and Configuration (`utils/logger.py`, `utils/config.py`)
- Logging is set up to track the system’s operations, which is essential for debugging and monitoring. Configuration settings are managed through environment variables.
